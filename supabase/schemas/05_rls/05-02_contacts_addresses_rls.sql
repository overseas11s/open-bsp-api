alter table public.contacts_addresses enable row level security;

-- A contact row is an entry in one connection's address book, so every policy
-- applies the ACCOUNT rule via get_visible_addresses(): shared inboxes
-- (ownerless accounts) are org-wide, a personal connection's contacts belong
-- to its owner — same rule the account's conversations follow. The org filter
-- is redundant with the visibility set but kept for symmetry with the other
-- policies (and as belt-and-braces, see 04-02).
