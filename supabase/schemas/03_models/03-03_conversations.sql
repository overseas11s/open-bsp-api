  -- The peer this conversation is with — an individual or a group/channel
  -- address (e.g. WhatsApp phone/group JID, Slack channel id). Soft reference
  -- (no FK): peers span contacts and external containers.
  --
  -- Always present. For services with a real peer it is that peer's address.
  -- `local` has no external peer, so it addresses itself, in one of two ways
  -- (before_insert_on_conversations):
  --
  --   roster   direct and multiple are DEFINED by who is in them, so the
  --            address IS the participant list — agent ids, sorted, joined by
  --            ':'. Canonical, so the unique index below is what answers "does
  --            this conversation already exist between these people", for two
  --            participants and for eight alike.
  --   own id   group and channel have a name and a mutable membership, so
  --            their identity is their own, and the address is the row's id.
  --
  -- Keeping it NOT NULL is what lets the identity index below be a plain
  -- unique constraint instead of one whose behaviour depends on NULL
  -- semantics.

  -- The shape of the channel, in one cross-service vocabulary:
  --
  --   direct     1:1        WhatsApp/Instagram DM, Slack im
  --   multiple   ad-hoc N   Slack mpim, Teams group chat
  --   group      private N  WhatsApp group, Slack/Teams private channel
  --   channel    public N   Slack public channel
  --   broadcast  fan-out    WhatsApp broadcast list
  --
  -- direct and multiple differ only in size; both are defined by their roster
  -- and neither can be joined or left. group and channel are named containers
  -- with a membership that changes. broadcast is not a conversation anyone is
  -- in — it fans out to N individual chats on the receiving side — and exists
  -- here because production already carries one (`…@broadcast`).
  --
  -- `text` + a check, deliberately not an enum: this column is referenced by
  -- an RLS policy, and `db diff` cannot add a value to an enum in that
  -- position (it attempts a recast and fails — see CLAUDE.md). More values
  -- are coming from whatsapp-web (newsletters/Channels), so the enum would
  -- cost a hand-written migration every time.
  --
  -- Set at creation and never changed afterwards, except on `local` where
  -- retyping a group as a channel is a real operation (Slack calls it
  -- "convert to public"). No API role can UPDATE a conversation on any other
  -- service (05-03), so a mirror row cannot be reclassified by a member.
  --
  -- Nullable, with no column default, so that "not classified yet" stays
  -- distinguishable from "classified as direct". Slack needs that: a reaction
  -- or a member_joined can create the row before anything knows the channel's
  -- kind, and ensureConversation re-resolves precisely while it is null. Every
  -- other path fills it — before_insert_on_conversations defaults it to
  -- `direct`, which is what a conversation minted from an incoming message is
  -- unless a connector said otherwise (generic-webhook states `group` for
  -- whatsapp-web group JIDs before the message lands).
  type text,
  -- Holds ingestor-owned facts (is_bot_member, channel_archived, topic,
  -- purpose) as well as cosmetic ones. Safe together because 05-03 grants no
  -- API role UPDATE on any service but `local`: the policy is what keeps
  -- members out, so nothing here needs a column of its own.

-- A conversation IS a channel: one row per peer on an account, for the life of
-- that peer. `id` is a convenience surrogate, not the identity.
--
-- This is what removes the lookup-then-insert race: every writer can upsert on
-- this key instead of select-then-maybe-insert.
--
-- Column ORDER is load-bearing, though uniqueness does not depend on it. With
-- organization_address second, the leading columns also serve:
--
--   (organization_id, organization_address, service)  the account FK below, so
--       deleting a connected account cascades by index scan (that cascade took
--       5.4 s against a sequential scan). Equality quals match the leading
--       columns in any order, so the FK's own column order need not agree.
--   (organization_id, organization_address)  "every conversation on this
--       account", the hottest lookup there is — 279k scans reading 539M tuples
--       through a single-column index, ~1.9k rows per probe on a shared number
--       carrying 13k conversations.
--   (organization_id)  the organization cascade.
--
-- Those three single-column indexes are therefore absent by design: this one
-- answers all of them, and each extra index is write cost on an insert path
-- that already runs a trigger cascade.
