-- An invitation is a pending offer of membership, not a member: an agents
-- row means a member, unconditionally. Keeping the pending state in its own
-- table means no access helper needs an exclusion clause it could forget —
-- and forgetting one anywhere would grant access to someone who never
-- replied.
--
-- EMAIL is the key. The invitee typically has no auth user yet, and when they
-- do they are not in the organization, so nothing about them can be named by
-- id at invitation time. Their identity is resolved once, at acceptance, from
-- the JWT.

  -- omits them — before_insert_or_update_on_invitations fills all three, and
  -- leaves the last two null when there is nobody to copy (invited_by null,
  -- or an agent from another organization). Note the email is the inviter's,
  -- and so is visible to every member through the policy below, which is the
