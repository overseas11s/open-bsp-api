-- Who is in a conversation. Two sources, by service:
--
--   mirror services  Membership of the container on the external service
--                    (Slack channel members) intersected with org members who
--                    connected it. Maintained by the service's webhook and
--                    management functions with the service role.
--
--   local            OpenBSP's own chat, where membership is the product:
--                    the creator is recorded by a trigger, and members add,
--                    join and leave through RLS (05-12).
--
-- Where a conversation is visible org-wide anyway (a shared inbox), a row
-- here is not what grants that — it just carries the member's own state for
-- the conversation in `extra`. 05-12 turns on exactly that distinction.

  -- one (their Slack identity T…:U…), NOT the shared anchor the conversation
  -- hangs off; on `local`, the org's single local address, which is the only
  -- one there is. Cascade makes "disconnect = delete the address row" drop
  -- this connection's visibility, and nothing from other services.
  --
  -- Always the conversation's own — a Slack membership stems from a Slack
  -- identity — so it is redundant in principle and required in practice:
  -- organizations_addresses is keyed on it, and the reference below cannot pin
  -- the account without it. Never written by a client: the a_set_service
  -- trigger derives it, so it cannot disagree with the conversation.
