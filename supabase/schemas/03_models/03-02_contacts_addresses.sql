-- A row is an entry in ONE connection's address book, so the account key
-- (organization_id, service, organization_address) is part of the PK:
--
--   * service: the same canonical address (e.g. bare phone digits shared by
--     'whatsapp' and 'whatsapp-web') is a separate row per service.
--   * organization_address: opaque counterpart ids (BSUID, LID) are only
--     meaningful relative to the account that observed them, and each
--     connection syncs its own contact list — the same person reachable
--     through two of the org's numbers is a row per number. Visibility
--     follows the account too (a personal connection's contacts are the
--     owner's, see 05-02).
--
-- There is deliberately no cross-service/cross-account identity layer:
-- openbsp is a comm layer, and who-is-who across services belongs to the
-- consumer.
