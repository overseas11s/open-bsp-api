-- Who sees a conversation: the ACCOUNT rule decides by default, and a
-- conversation may override it.
--
--   Account (organizations_addresses.agent_id):
--     null => public — a shared inbox, visible to the whole org
--     set  => private — a personal account, visible to its owner
--
--   Restriction (get_restricted_conversations below):
--     the account rule is suppressed for conversations two services host on
--     an ownerless account without meaning "shared with the whole org".
--     Those are visible to conversations_agents participants only.
--
-- The restriction exists because one ownerless account can host both modes:
--
--   slack  The workspace anchor is ownerless and holds the bot — the
--          shared-inbox connection, exactly like a common WhatsApp number —
--          while each member's T…:U… row is personal. Every conversation
--          hangs off the anchor regardless of which connection it arrived
--          through, so "is this shared?" is a fact about the conversation.
--          The bot's presence IS that fact, and is what the webhook actually
--          observes (member_joined/left_channel), so it is what we store.
--          Absent means absent: a conversation the bot is not in is not
--          shared, which is the fail-closed direction.
--
--   local  One ownerless account per org hosts the whole internal chat, so
--          the account says nothing. Shape decides instead, exactly as it
--          would in Slack or Teams: `channel` is open to the org, everything
--          else (direct, multiple, group) is for its participants.
--
-- Both services are named explicitly, rather than reading a flag every
-- ingestor would have to remember to write — an absent flag fails open, and
-- this must fail closed. A new service that needs a restriction adds a line
-- here; one that does not, adds nothing.
--
-- There is deliberately NO role bypass: owners/admins cannot read a member's
-- personal conversations. API keys authenticate without auth.uid(), so they
-- only ever see shared-inbox content.
--
-- SHAPE: these return SETS and take no per-row arguments, so the policies can
-- call them as `x in (select …)` — an InitPlan evaluated once per query and
-- then hash-probed per row, the same trick that makes get_authorized_orgs
-- cheap. A boolean helper taking the row's columns cannot get that treatment:
-- it is re-invoked per row, and being SECURITY DEFINER it cannot be inlined
-- either.

-- Accounts whose conversations the caller can see, as (organization_id,
-- service, address) triples: the org's shared inboxes, plus personal accounts
-- the caller owns. Conversations under these are visible unless their override
-- says private.
--
-- service is in the tuple because it is in the account key: the same address
-- string can name a shared 'whatsapp' account and a personal 'whatsapp-web'
-- one, and matching on the pair alone would let either decide for both.
